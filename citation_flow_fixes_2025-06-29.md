# Citation Flow Fixes - 2025-06-29

## Summary of Issues and Fixes

### Issues Identified from Test Logs

1. **Citations stored in backend but not displayed in frontend**
   - Backend: "Storing 3 citations for message"
   - Frontend: No [1], [2], [3] markers appearing

2. **Analysis blocks stored but not rendered**
   - Backend: "Transaction complete - message has 4 analysis blocks"
   - Frontend: "Fetched updated message with 0 analysis blocks"

### Root Causes Found

1. **Frontend Property Mapping Issue**
   - Frontend was only checking for `analysis_blocks` (snake_case)
   - Backend might be sending `analysisBlocks` (camelCase) due to Pydantic alias configuration

2. **Citation Marker Issue**
   - MessageRenderer expects [1], [2], [3] markers in the message content
   - Backend stores citations but doesn't add these markers to the content

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Updated Frontend Property Mapping (`/src/lib/api/conversations.ts`)
```typescript
// Before:
analysis_blocks: msg.analysis_blocks || []

// After:
analysis_blocks: msg.analysis_blocks || msg.analysisBlocks || []
content_blocks: msg.content_blocks || msg.contentBlocks || []
```

#### 2. Added Debug Logging
```typescript
console.log('Conversation history response:', response);
if (response.length > 0) {
  console.log('First message structure:', {
    hasAnalysisBlocks: !!(response[0].analysisBlocks),
    hasAnalysis_blocks: !!(response[0].analysis_blocks),
    analysisBlocskLength: response[0].analysisBlocks?.length || response[0].analysis_blocks?.length || 0,
    hasCitations: !!(response[0].citations),
    citationsLength: response[0].citations?.length || 0
  });
}
```

### Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes**
   - Check browser console for the debug logging
   - Verify if analysis blocks are now being received
   - Check if citations are in the response

2. **If citations are present but not showing:**
   - Backend needs to add [1], [2], [3] markers to message content
   - OR frontend needs to inject markers based on citation positions

3. **If analysis blocks still not showing:**
   - Check the actual API response in Network tab
   - Verify the Pydantic model serialization in backend
