# Next.js Migration Status

## Completed
1. Created Next.js application structure with App Router
2. Implemented basic UI components:
   - Home page
   - Dashboard page with document list and stats
   - Workspace page with chat interface and analysis tabs
   - Header component with navigation
   - Basic UI utilities and components
3. Set up styling with Tailwind CSS
4. Added utility functions for common operations
5. Created route structure matching the requirements

## In Progress
1. API services for connecting to the backend
2. Core components:
   - PDF Viewer with annotation and highlighting
   - Chat Interface with API integration
   - Analysis components for visualization
3. API routes for backend operations
4. State management with React Context

   - Analysis blocks with citation linking
   - Data transformations for visualization
   
4. API Routes 
   - Document management endpoints
   - Conversation API endpoints
   - Analysis API endpoints
   
5. Authentication
   - User login and registration
   - Session management
   - Authorization for API routes
   
6. Context Providers

7. Add authentication and authorization
8. Test and optimize the application

## Migration Challenges
1. State Management: Moving from a simple React state model to Next.js context providers
2. PDF Viewer: Ensuring compatibility with react-pdf-highlighter in the Next.js environment
3. API Integration: Setting up proper API routes and services 
4. Authentication: Implementing secure authentication with Next.js
5. Performance: Optimizing for server components and client components balance
