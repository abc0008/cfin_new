# Citation Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Backend Citation Timing**: Citations were being blocked after `tool_start`
2. **Frontend Content Duplication**: Content was being appended instead of replaced
3. **No Citation Hyperlinking**: Citations appeared as plain text, not clickable links
4. **Content State Management**: Multiple content updates were not handled properly

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **`services/conversation_service.py`**:
   - Allow citation `text_delta` events to pass through after `tool_start` (lines 942-955)
   - Update frozen content when citation markers arrive (lines 950-952)
   - Citations are now preserved through the entire message lifecycle

### Frontend Changes

1. **`src/hooks/useStreamingChatWithCitations.ts`**:
   - Added logic to prevent content duplication when citations are added (lines 174-186)
   - Exposed `streamingCitations` in the hook return (line 635)
   - Better handling of `content_update` events to avoid duplication

2. **`src/components/chat/TextWithCitations.tsx`** (NEW):
   - Created component to parse and render citation markers as clickable links
   - Converts [1], [2], [3] markers into blue clickable buttons
   - Handles citation click events to navigate to PDF locations

3. **`src/components/ui/streaming-indicators.tsx`**:
   - Updated `StreamingMessage` to accept citations and onCitationClick props
   - Integrated `TextWithCitations` component for citation rendering
   - Dynamic import to avoid circular dependencies

4. **`src/components/chat/StreamingChatInterface.tsx`**:
   - Extract `streamingCitations` from the hook
   - Pass citations and click handler to `StreamingMessage`

## How Citations Work Now

1. **Streaming Phase**: Claude streams response without citations
2. **Final Message**: Claude sends citations in `final_message`
3. **Backend Processing**: 
   - Citations sent as `text_delta` events with markers [1], [2], [3]
   - Citation markers allowed through even after `tool_start`
   - Frozen content updated to include citation markers
4. **Frontend Display**:
   - Citation markers rendered as clickable blue buttons
   - Click handler navigates to PDF location
   - Citations persist through all message updates

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Upload a PDF document
2. Ask a question that requires citations
3. Verify:
   - Citations appear as clickable [1], [2], [3] buttons
   - No content duplication
   - Citations persist through visualization updates
   - Clicking citations navigates to PDF locations
