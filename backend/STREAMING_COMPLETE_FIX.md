# Complete Streaming Fix - No Duplicate or Unformatted Text

## Root Cause Analysis

The duplicate unformatted text issue was caused by multiple factors:

1. **Backend was using `analysis_text` as fallback**: The API returns unformatted text in `analysis_text`, which should NEVER be used in streaming mode
2. **Unnecessary `message_update` events**: The backend was sending final message updates that could contain unformatted content
3. **Frontend fetches from DB on completion**: When `message_complete` fires, frontend fetches the message from DB, which might contain unformatted content

## Complete Fix Implementation

### 1. Block All Text Events After Tool Start
```python
# Added flag to track tool usage in current stream
tool_start_processed_in_current_stream = False

# Block all text events after tools start
if tool_start_processed_in_current_stream:
    if event_type == "text_delta":
        logger.info(f"üö´ Blocking text_delta event after tool_start...")
        return
    if event_type == "content_update":
        if not (event.get("is_post_tools") and event.get("post_tool_text")):
            logger.info(f"üö´ Blocking content_update event after tool_start...")
            return
```

### 2. Never Use analysis_text from API Result
```python
# CRITICAL: For streaming, we should NEVER use analysis_text from the API result
# The frontend already has the properly formatted text from streaming
if analysis_text:
    logger.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Ignoring analysis_text ({len(analysis_text)} chars) - using streaming content only")

# Removed the fallback logic that used analysis_text
# Now only uses streaming content or a generic fallback message
```

### 3. Never Send message_update Events
```python
# CRITICAL: Never send message_update events during streaming
# The frontend will fetch the complete message from the database when needed
# Sending updates here can cause formatting issues and duplicate content
logger.info(f"‚úÖ NOT sending message_update - frontend will fetch from DB when needed")
```

### 4. Content Preservation Logic
- When `tool_start` is received, freeze the current formatted content
- If any overwrites are detected, restore the frozen content
- Database always contains the properly formatted streaming content

## How It Works Now

1. **During Streaming**:
   - Text is streamed via `text_delta` events with proper formatting
   - Database is updated via `content_update` events (only pre-tool)
   - When tools start, content is frozen and no more text updates are accepted

2. **After Streaming**:
   - NO `message_update` event is sent
   - `analysis_text` from API is completely ignored
   - Database contains only the formatted streaming content

3. **When Frontend Completes**:
   - Frontend fetches message from DB (which has good content)
   - Message is displayed with proper formatting
   - No duplicate or unformatted text appears

## Key Principles

1. **Streaming is the source of truth**: In streaming mode, only use content received during streaming
2. **Never use API fallbacks**: `analysis_text` should be ignored completely in streaming mode
3. **Minimize events**: Don't send unnecessary update events that could confuse the frontend
4. **Freeze on tool start**: Once tools begin, the formatted content is locked in

## Testing Verification

- ‚úÖ Queries with visualizations show formatted initial text
- ‚úÖ No duplicate text appears after visualizations
- ‚úÖ Database contains only formatted content
- ‚úÖ Simple Q&A (no tools) still works correctly
- ‚úÖ No "Streaming message update" with unformatted content
