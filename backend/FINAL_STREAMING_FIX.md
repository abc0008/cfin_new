# Final Streaming Fix - No Duplicates, Preserve Formatting

## The Problem
Users were seeing duplicated messages where:
1. First half: Properly formatted text with line breaks, bullet points, numbered lists
2. Second half: EXACT same content but with ALL formatting stripped

Example:
```
Let me analyze the data.

1. First point
2. Second point
3. Third point

Let me analyze the data. 1. First point 2. Second point 3. Third point
```

## Root Cause
Claude's streaming API sends content multiple times across different "turns":
- **Turn 1**: Initial response with proper formatting (1299 chars)
- **Turn 2**: After tools, sends the SAME content again but without formatting

The `analyze_with_visualization_tools_streaming` method was accumulating BOTH versions, resulting in duplicated content (2598 chars total).

## The Fix

### 1. In `analyze_with_visualization_tools_streaming` (api_service.py)
**NEVER accumulate text across turns for streaming**:
```python
if response_text and turn == 0:
    # First turn - this is our properly formatted text
    accumulated_text = response_text
    logger.info(f"Turn {turn + 1}: Initial streaming text preserved ({len(response_text)} chars)")
elif response_text and turn > 0:
    # Subsequent turns - DO NOT ACCUMULATE
    # Claude often sends the same content again without formatting
    logger.info(f"Turn {turn + 1}: Ignoring {len(response_text)} chars to prevent duplication")
    # DO NOT update accumulated_text - keep the original formatted version
```

### 2. In `process_user_message_streaming` (conversation_service.py)
**Always prefer streaming content over analysis_text**:
```python
if assistant_message_placeholder.content and assistant_message_placeholder.content != "Processing your request...":
    # Use the streaming content that was built up - this has proper formatting
    final_content = assistant_message_placeholder.content
    logger.info(f"📝 Using streaming content ({len(final_content)} chars) - ignoring analysis_text ({len(analysis_text)} chars)")
```

### 3. Smart content updates
- Only send `content_update` events in batches (50+ chars or at line breaks)
- Ignore post-tool content updates completely
- Skip redundant database updates if content hasn't changed

## Result
- ✅ No more duplicated messages
- ✅ Formatting is preserved (line breaks, bullet points, numbered lists)
- ✅ Only the initial, properly formatted response is shown
- ✅ Unformatted duplicate content is completely ignored

## How it works
1. User sends a query
2. Claude streams the initial response with proper formatting
3. This formatted text is saved to the database
4. When Claude sends tools or subsequent turns with duplicate content, we ignore them
5. The final message shown to the user is the original formatted response only
