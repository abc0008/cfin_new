# Complete Streaming Fix - No Duplication, Preserve Formatting

## The Problem (Detailed Analysis)

The user was seeing duplicated messages where:
1. **During streaming**: Properly formatted text appears (1310 chars)
2. **After streaming stops**: The ENTIRE message is replaced with duplicated, unformatted text (2620 chars)

The duplication happened because:
1. Claude sends the response in Turn 1 with proper formatting
2. After tools, Claude sends the SAME content AGAIN in Turn 2 (without formatting)
3. The backend was accumulating both versions and returning them
4. Even though we tried to prefer streaming content, new streaming events from Turn 2 were overwriting the good content

## The Complete Fix

### 1. Filter out duplicate streaming events from subsequent turns
In `analyze_with_visualization_tools_streaming`:
```python
async def filtered_emit_callback(event: Dict[str, Any]):
    if turn > 0:
        # After first turn, only allow tool-related events
        allowed_types = {'tool_start', 'tool_complete', 'chart_ready', 'table_ready', 'metric_ready'}
        if event.get('type') not in allowed_types:
            logger.info(f"Turn {turn + 1}: Blocking {event.get('type')} event to prevent duplicate content")
            return
    # Pass through allowed events
    if emit_callback:
        await emit_callback(event)
```

### 2. Don't accumulate text across turns
Already implemented - we only keep text from Turn 1.

### 3. Return empty analysis_text for streaming mode
```python
# CRITICAL: For streaming, we should NOT return accumulated_text
# The frontend already has the properly formatted text from streaming
current_analysis_text = ""  # Empty for streaming mode

result = {
    "analysis_text": current_analysis_text,  # Empty to prevent duplication
    "visualizations": {
        "charts": accumulated_charts,
        "tables": accumulated_tables
    },
    "metrics": accumulated_metrics
}
```

### 4. Conversation service already prefers streaming content
The conversation service will use the streaming content (which has proper formatting) and ignore the empty analysis_text.

## How It Works Now

1. **Turn 1**: Claude streams formatted response
   - Text events are emitted normally
   - Content is saved to database with formatting
   - Tool events are processed

2. **Turn 2+**: Claude may send duplicate content
   - ALL text/content events are BLOCKED
   - Only tool events are allowed through
   - No duplicate content reaches frontend

3. **Final result**:
   - `analysis_text` is empty (prevents any duplicate from being used)
   - Streaming content in database is preserved
   - No duplication occurs

## Result
- ✅ No more duplicated messages
- ✅ Formatting is always preserved
- ✅ Only the initial formatted response is shown
- ✅ Tools still work correctly
