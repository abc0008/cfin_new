# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
After implementing citation support, WebSocket showed "disconnected" and streaming wasn't working.

## Root Cause
The `useStreamingChatWithCitations` hook was incomplete. It only had citation handling logic but was missing all the WebSocket connection implementation.

### What Was Missing:
1. WebSocket connection logic (`connectWebSocket` function)
2. WebSocket state management (`wsRef`)
3. Reconnection logic
4. Actual implementation of `sendStreamingMessage` and `sendStreamingMessageHTTP`
5. Connection lifecycle management
6. Auto-connect on mount

### What Was There:
- Citation event handling
- Citation state management
- Placeholder functions that just logged to console

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added WebSocket Implementation
Copied the complete WebSocket implementation from `useStreamingChat` into `useStreamingChatWithCitations`:
- WebSocket connection establishment
- Reconnection with exponential backoff
- Connection state management
- Error handling

### 2. Implemented Message Sending
- `sendStreamingMessage`: Sends messages via WebSocket
- `sendStreamingMessageHTTP`: HTTP fallback for streaming

### 3. Added Auto-Connect
- WebSocket automatically connects when component mounts
- Proper cleanup on unmount

### 4. Fixed Document Map Type
- Changed from object to Map to match hook expectations

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the application**
   - Backend should be running on port 8000
   - Frontend should be running on port 3000

2. **Check WebSocket Connection**
   - Open browser console
   - Should see: "Starting WebSocket connection to: ws://localhost:8000/ws/conversation/{id}"
   - Should see: "WebSocket connected and isConnected set to true"

3. **Test Streaming**
   - Upload a document
   - Ask a question
   - Should see streaming response with real-time text updates
   - Should see citation events if document has citations

4. **Monitor Console**
   - Look for "WebSocket onopen event fired"
   - Check for streaming events being received
   - Verify no "disconnected" status

## Success Indicators
- ✅ WebSocket shows "connected" status
- ✅ Messages stream in real-time
- ✅ Citations are collected during streaming
- ✅ No fallback to HTTP mode
- ✅ Reconnection works if connection drops

## Common Issues
- If still disconnected, check backend is running
- Ensure CORS is configured for WebSocket
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Verify conversation ID is valid
