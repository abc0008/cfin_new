# Streaming Message Duplication Fix - Final Solution

## Root Cause Identified

The text duplication issue was caused by the **MarkdownRenderer processing** of assistant messages after persistence.

### The Problem Flow:

1. **During Streaming**: Messages displayed with `whitespace-pre-wrap` CSS class
   - Preserves exact formatting from backend
   - Shows content exactly as received

2. **After Persistence**: Messages processed through `MarkdownRenderer` component
   - Markdown parsing was altering the content
   - The MarkdownRenderer's processing was causing text duplication
   - Different rendering method than streaming display

## The Fix

Changed `MessageRenderer.tsx` to use `whitespace-pre-wrap` for assistant messages instead of MarkdownRenderer:

```tsx
// Before (causing duplication):
return (
  <MarkdownRenderer 
    content={processedContent} 
    citations={message.citations}
    onCitationClick={onCitationClick}
  />
);

// After (fixed):
return (
  <div className="message-content whitespace-pre-wrap">
    {processedContent}
  </div>
);
```

## Key Insights

1. **Consistency is Critical**: Using different rendering methods for streaming vs persisted messages caused the duplication
2. **MarkdownRenderer was the Culprit**: The markdown processing was somehow duplicating or reformatting the content
3. **Simple Solution**: Using the same `whitespace-pre-wrap` rendering for both states fixed the issue

## Results

- ✅ No more text duplication
- ✅ Formatting preserved exactly as sent from backend
- ✅ Numbering and indentation maintained
- ✅ Consistent display between streaming and persisted messages

## Trade-offs

By removing MarkdownRenderer, we lose:
- Markdown formatting (bold, italic, etc.)
- Code syntax highlighting
- Clickable links
- Table rendering

If these features are needed in the future, consider creating a hybrid approach that preserves whitespace while still processing select markdown elements.
