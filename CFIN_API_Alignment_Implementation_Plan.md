# CFIN API Alignment Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan to address misalignments between frontend and backend API endpoints in the CFIN project.

## 1. Endpoint Misalignments

### 1.1 Single Document to Conversation Endpoint Mismatch

- [x] Examine and understand the existing `/conversation/{conversation_id}/documents` endpoint
- [x] Create a new route in backend API for the single document endpoint with path `/conversation/{conversation_id}/document/{document_id}`
- [x] Implement route handler using the existing add_document_to_conversation service method
- [x] Add appropriate error handling to the new endpoint
- [x] Test the endpoint with the frontend integration

### 1.2 Error Handling Inconsistency

- [x] Audit frontend API services error handling patterns
  - Frontend has a sophisticated error handling system in `apiService.ts` with:
    - HTTP error detection and JSON/text error message extraction
    - Structured handling of different error response formats
    - Error retry logic with exponential backoff
    - Schema validation with Zod for responses
    - Consistent error propagation and logging
- [x] Audit backend API endpoints error response formats
  - Backend uses FastAPI's HTTPException for error responses with:
    - Appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500, etc.)
    - String-based 'detail' field containing error messages
    - Specific error handling for different exception types (ValueError, general Exception)
    - Logging of errors with varying levels (error, exception)
    - Some inconsistency in error message formats and field names
- [x] Create consistent error response structure across frontend and backend
  - Created standardized `ErrorResponse` model in `models/error.py` with:
    - `status_code` field for HTTP status code
    - `detail` field for error message (string, validation errors array, or structured data)
    - `error_type` field for categorizing errors (e.g., "not_found", "validation_error")
  - Created utility functions in `utils/error_handling.py` for:
    - Converting exceptions to standardized error responses
    - Custom exception handlers for FastAPI
    - Consistent error logging
  - Updated FastAPI app in `app/main.py` to use these custom exception handlers
- [x] Update frontend API services to handle backend error responses consistently
  - Created `ApiError` class in `errors/ApiError.ts` that represents standardized error responses
  - Updated `apiService.ts` to handle the new error structure and backward compatibility
  - Added smart error handling with type checking and useful utility methods
  - Improved retry logic to avoid retrying on client errors (4xx)
  - Enhanced error message formatting for better user experience
- [x] Test error scenarios to ensure consistent behavior
  - Created backend test file `tests/test_error_handling.py` to verify error response formats
  - Created frontend test file `src/tests/api/errorHandling.test.ts` for API error handling
  - Tested various error scenarios: not found, validation errors, server errors
  - Verified error retry logic and backward compatibility with older error formats
  - Ensured consistent error types and structure between frontend and backend

### 1.3 Document Citation Route Inconsistency

- [x] Verify frontend document citation endpoint: `/document/${documentId}/citations`
- [x] Examine backend implementation of citation retrieval
- [x] Ensure route paths match between frontend and backend
- [x] Standardize citation data structure between frontend and backend
- [x] Test citation retrieval flow end-to-end

## 2. Implementation Summary

All API alignment tasks have been successfully completed. The implementation includes:

1. A new single document endpoint that matches the frontend expected route
2. Standardized error handling across frontend and backend
3. Consistent citation retrieval between frontend and backend
4. Comprehensive test coverage for error scenarios

These changes will improve error handling, developer experience, and maintainability of the codebase.
