# Streaming Message Persistence Fix

## Problem
The initial streaming message was disappearing at the end of tool execution because:
1. Frontend fetches from DB when `message_complete` fires
2. DB might not have visualizations yet (timing issue)
3. Frontend finds 0 visualizations, creates no messages
4. Cleanup runs and clears `streamingText`, leaving UI empty

## Solution
Never clear the streaming text except when starting a new message. The streaming text represents a complete message that should remain visible.

### Key Changes in useStreamingChat.ts

#### 1. Never Clear Streaming Text on Completion (line 434)
```typescript
// Never clear streaming text - it's a complete message that should stay visible
console.log(`✅ Keeping streaming message visible`);
```

#### 2. Only Clear When Starting New Message (line 109)
```typescript
// Initialize for new message - this is the ONLY place we clear streaming text
setStreamingText(''); // Clear for new message
```

#### 3. Add Delay for DB Transaction (lines 313-316)
```typescript
// Add a small delay to ensure DB transaction completes
if (currentToolsStarted) {
  console.log(`⏳ Waiting for DB transaction to complete...`);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
}
```

## How It Works

1. **New Message Starts**: Clear `streamingText` to start fresh
2. **During Streaming**: Text accumulates and displays in real-time
3. **Tools Execute**: Message stays visible (no clearing)
4. **Message Complete**: 
   - Wait 500ms for DB transaction if tools were used
   - Fetch visualizations from DB
   - Create visualization messages if found
   - **Never clear the streaming text**
5. **Next Message**: When a new message starts, only then clear the old text

## Benefits

- Messages are permanent once streamed
- No disappearing content
- Simpler logic - no conditional clearing
- Natural message flow - old messages stay until new ones arrive
- Works for all cases: with tools, without tools, errors, etc.

## Key Insight

The streaming text IS the message. There's no need to clear it or replace it. It should persist as the user's conversation history. Only when a new message starts streaming should the old content be cleared to make room for the new message.
