# Citation Fixes Implemented - 2025-06-29

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Debug Logging (conversation.py)
- Added logging to show how many citations are loaded from database
- Added logging to show citation data before and after transformation
- This helps verify if citations are being fetched properly

### 2. Fixed Citation Marker Injection (conversation_service.py)
- Added logic to inject citation markers into message content
- Checks if markers already exist to avoid duplication
- If no markers exist, adds a "Sources:" section at the end with [1], [2], [3] references
- Citation markers are added BEFORE storing the final message

## How It Works

1. During streaming, citations are accumulated
2. After streaming completes, before finalizing the message:
   - Check if citation markers [1], [2], etc. already exist
   - If not, append a Sources section with numbered references
   - Update the message content with these markers
3. Store the citations in the database linked to the message
4. When frontend fetches the message, it will see:
   - The content with citation markers
   - The citations array with full citation data
   - MessageRenderer will make the markers clickable

## Testing Instructions

1. Upload a PDF document
2. Ask a question that will trigger citations (e.g., "How has credit performed?")
3. Check for:
   - Citation markers [1], [2], [3] appearing in the message
   - Clickable citations that navigate to the PDF
   - Sources section at the end of the message

## Expected Behavior

Messages should now show citations in one of two ways:
1. Inline markers if Claude provides them during streaming
2. A "Sources:" section at the end with numbered references

The frontend MessageRenderer will detect these [1], [2], [3] markers and make them clickable.
