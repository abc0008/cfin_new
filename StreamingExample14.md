Let me provide a comprehensive analysis of the loan performance based on the financial documents.
The loan portfolio shows consistent growth and generally healthy performance across multiple dimensions from 2024Q1 to 2025Q1, though there are some signs of modest credit quality deterioration that warrant monitoring.
Total loans have shown steady growth, increasing from $42 billion in 2024Q1 to $45 billion in 2025Q1, representing a 7.1% increase over the period. All major loan categories have contributed to this growth, with C&I loans being the largest segment and showing particularly strong performance.
The credit quality metrics show some modest deterioration:
Non-performing assets have gradually increased from $350M to $390M
Net charge-offs have increased from $25M to $32M
The allowance for loan losses has grown from $350M to $390M, suggesting the bank is building reserves in response to both loan growth and potentially increasing credit risk
Let me break this down with some detailed visualizations:
